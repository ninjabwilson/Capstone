# Capstone Final Project
The objective of the capstone project was a simulation of a professional pentest engagement and mitigation presentation. It highlightened a variety of skills learned throughout the Bootcamp through acting as both pentester and SOC analyst responder on a virtual network created in Azure.

*Skills Included*
- Implement alarms and thresholds in Elasticsearch Watcher.
- Find vulnerabilities / exploits to gain access to a vulnerable WordPress site / server.
- Use Wireshark to analyze and find malicious traffic on the wire.
- Create a team presentation with the assessment, analysis and hardening of the vulnerable system.

*Presentation Details*

I was assigned with a team to bring our individual findings together to create a group presentation on the last day of our Cybersecurity Bootcamp.

We worked together to practice digital collaboration, as classrooms were unavailable at this time due to Covid-19.
I shared and analyzed the data I found with the team during our individual Red Team exploitation and Blue Team response phases of the project.

I coordinated with the team to construct a professional PowerPoint presentation explaining our findings. The presentation itself simulated an executive meeting to address mitigation strategies following a Pentest engagement on a company network. 

This presentation was done online in front of all Bootcamp Instructors and students at the conclusion of the course.
